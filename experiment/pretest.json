        "c": "An XOR (exclusive OR) gate outputs a high (1) when its inputs are different (one is 0, the other is 1).If both inputs are the same (both 0 or both 1), the output is low (0).",

        "a": "The E-XOR gate produces a high output (1) only when there is a difference in the input values. This property is what makes it 'exclusive' â€” it outputs 1 for different inputs (0,1 or 1,0) and 0 for identical inputs (0,0 or 1,1).",
